== Weave

I built this app using Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS.

Weave is a simple to do list manager app. Users log in (or sign up) with their email and password,
and can create todo lists (with descriptions). Within each todo list, you can add all the tasks
you want to complete and check them off (or delete) as you go. 

User authentication is handled using the Devise Gem.
